   <br>
## 2. Duration
24.06.25 ~ 24.08.30

## 3. Project
### 1) Combat Simulation Utilizing Object-Oriented Programming

(1) Two players take turns playing the game. <br>
(2) Before the game starts, the health, mana, attack power, and defense of the player objects can be determined. <br>
(3) Players can choose one of four actions: move, attack, special attack, or heal. <br>
(4) Movement allows the player to move one square in the X or Y direction on a 2D grid. <br>
(5) Attack allows the player to attack an opponent within one square. <br>
(6) Special attack consumes mana to attack an opponent within one square. <br>
(7) Heal consumes mana to restore health. <br>
(8) Players take turns performing these actions, and the player who reduces the opponent's health to zero wins the game. <br>
### 2) Chess Game
